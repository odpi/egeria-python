# pyegeria: a python client for Egeria

This is an experimental package for easily using the Egeria
open metadata environment from python. Details about the
open source Egeria project can be found at [Egeria Project](https://egeria-project.org).

This package is in active development. There is initial
support for Egeria's platform services and configuration of Open Metadata and Governance servers
along with some basic utilities. 
Next will be additional support to configure and operate servers, followed
by glossary support.

The code is organized to mimic the existing Egeria Java Client structure.

All feedback is welcome. Please engage via our [community](http://egeria-project.org/guides/community/),

This is a learning experience.
