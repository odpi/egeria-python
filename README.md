# pyegeria: a python client for Egeria

This is an experimental package for easily using the Egeria
open metadata environment from python. Details about the
open source Egeria project can be found at [Egeria Project](https://egeria-project.org).

This package is in active development. There is initial
support for Egeria's platform services and configuration of Open Metadata and Governance servers
along with some basic utilities. This client depends on Egeria 4.4 Snapshot and above - although most of 
the functions may work on earlier versions of Egeria as well. 

The code is organized to mimic the existing Egeria Java Client structure.

A new examples folder holds some useful text widgets that help to visualize the status of an Egeria deployment.
